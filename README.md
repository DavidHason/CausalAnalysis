Improved Churn Causal Analysis Through Restrained  Highâ€‘Dimensional Feature Space Efects in Financial Institutions

A causal discovery performed to fnd possible interpretation methods to describe cause probabilities that lead to customer churn.
Experiments were conducted on 12 datasets for members holding accounts provided by a local fnance company. All 12 datasets included customer accounts, demographics, customer engagement, and fnancial data, with approximately 250,000 examples with 88 features (71 numerical and 17 nominal) in each dataset. Also, We employed Bayesian causal graphs to encode assumptions and determine dependency levels between features, using the DoWhy python package.
